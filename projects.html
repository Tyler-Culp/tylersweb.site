        <p>A list of some projects I have done over the last year or so. Here is my <a id="gitLink" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Tyler-Culp?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Github</a> in case you would like
            to see the source code for a few projects.</p>

            <li><p><b>Android Compass App</b></p>
                <p class="listP">
                    This was a quarter long project that I worked on with a team of 6 people consisting of two app iterations. The first was an app where you could input 3 different
                    coordinate (assumedly corresponding to your house, your parent's house, and a friend's house) and 3 unique labels and then see icons of those house including your labels
                    on a live compass. This compass would update as you turned your phone or moved locations, meaning that the icons corresponding to each set of coordinates would always be pointing
                    in the same direction. In the second iteration instead of inputing coordinate, you inputted friends unique ID's to be able to pull their current live coordinates from a database. This
                    version of the compass would update as you turned your phone or moved around, or as your friend's moved around. Both applications were fully built in Android Studio using mainly Java.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><b>Marvel Movie Success Predictor</b></p>
            <p class="listP">In this project I worked with a team of 5 other people where we tried to discover if there was a way to predict the success of a
                 marvel movie, both critically and commercially, based on general movie statistics like its run time, budget, year released, etc. 
                 This was mainly done with python inside of Jupyter Notebooks where we used libraries like pandas, numpy, patsy, statsmodels, etc.
                 Through this project we found that things like production budget did have a positive correlation with the success of the movie.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>Top Spotify Songs</b></p>
                <p class="listP">This was a project I worked on last Summer where I attempted to make a Spotify web application that would allow a user to log into
                    their spotify account and then show what their top songs are for all time on the platform. It would also allow you to view main profile
                    features like number of playlists or number of friends on the app.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><b>This Website!</b></p>
                <p class="listP">I fully built this website from scratch starting with HTML, and then styling it with my own CSS, and finally adding in some JavaScript
                    to give the website a little more interactivity. This was a great way of diving head first into front end development and I got some great insights
                    into how the web actually works!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><b>MineSweeper</b></p>
                <p class="listP">A fun little pet project which recreates MineSweeper fully using java code. It allows you to play the game from within the computer's terminal.
                    Doesn't do too much other than that, but can be a fun little time killer.

                <p id="firstP" class="paragraphs">My name is Tyler and I am a recent graduate from UC San Diego with a degree in Mathematics-Computer Science. I was born and raised in Sacramento, California,
                 attending C.K. McClatchy highschool where I played baseball and wrestled for all four years. Growing up in Sacramento I always enjoyed being outdoors, spending lots of my Summers at the river with friends. 
                 This carried over to my time in San Diego as well with my trying to stop by the beach whenever I got the free time for it. Now I am pursuing a masters degree in Computer Science at UC Davis and am happy
                 to get the opportunity to be close to home once again.

                <h3>My Journey in Software</h3>
                <p id="secondP" class="paragraphs"> When entering college at UC San Diego I had no real concept of what software engineering really was. In fact, most things relating to computers were somewhat of a mystery to me.
                    On a whim, I decided to take an intro to programming class at the end of my freshman year and I found that I really enjoyed it. From then on I was hooked, I knew that
                    software was what I wanted to do. I decided to pursue a degree in Mathematics-Computer Science the next quarter and now after two years, and tons of computer science classes,
                    I graduated with a degree in Mathematics-Computer Science in June 2023.

                <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <p class="paragraphs"> Outside of my school life I enjoy staying active and going to the gym, muay thai practices, or the baseball field with friends. I also liked taking advantage of UC San Diego's location and visiting the beach as often as possible
                    . Like most people I also love to play my fair share of video games, my favorite being Hollow Knight, and even joined the video game developement club at UCSD where I made some simple games using Unity.
